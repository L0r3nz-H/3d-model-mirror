## 📝 Description
I couldn't find any existing models that perfectly fitted my needs (collecting coins from 50 cents to 2 euros and were not too bulky), so I designed my own model.
Feel free to customize the dimensions (or anything else) to better suit your preferences.
The Fusion360 file is provided for your convenience.

It is completely modeled from scratch, but the design inspiration is from [loetkolben82](https://www.printables.com/@loetkolben82) with [his Euro Coin Collector](https://www.printables.com/model/545534-euro-coin-collector).
