## 📝 Description
This is my remix of the [Sensor Node Enclosure for ESP8266] (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2363763) by [calvinboey] (https://www.thingiverse.com/calvinboey/designs) on Thingiverse.

I changed it in order to fit an ESP8266 and a BMP180, so I made it smaller and closed nearly all openings. Other sensors should also fit in the box, but I haven't tested it yet.

One example for a project is a [temperature sensor with Telegram integration. (Instructions are in German)] (https://polluxlabs.net/esp8266-projekte/ueberwache-die-temperatur-mit-telegram-und-einem-esp8266/)
