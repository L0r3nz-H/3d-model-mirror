## 📝 Description
Simple brackets for mounting an external monitor PSU to the wall or under a desk.

The PSU this was modelled for came with two of my monitors, both Samsung c24f396fhr (24inch curved 1080p displays).

This is designed for Samsung Bn44-00989a. There might others that fit. The PSU dimensions are roundabout 32x72x62mm.

One of them is already 2 year in usage and another one for more than one year. I printed it in PLA and for me it worked fine.
