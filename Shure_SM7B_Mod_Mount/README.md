## 📝 Description
After seeing [Caleb Pikes Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdt8GCBKEHk) about building a SM7B with a XM8500 or SM58, I instantly knew, that I wanted to build one.

I had my problems with the 5/8 mount, he put on it, so I made my own mount. I also had a Tonor TC30 laying around, therefore I used the tripod of that one.

I also made a version, where you can use the original XM8500 Mount and it works great.

For all prints I recommend 100% Infill and printing it in the orientation of the 3d model with support.

The rest of the body can be found as a free download on [camerafoundry](https://camerafoundry.com/products/shure-sm7b-3d-print).
