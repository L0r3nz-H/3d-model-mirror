## 📝 Description
Here's my FritzBox 6490 Stand, I designed it to have a better cooling for the Fritzbox. For lucky owners of the hot 6490, I would advise switching Wi-Fi overnight automatically off.
The alignment issue (which is visible on the second picture) is already fixed before uploading this project.
It should be also compatible with Fritzbox 7490 and others, that are identical in construction.

This stand is based on [Fritzbox 6490 "feet"](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:990085) from m4uli on Thingiverse, but this raises the Router not that high and is based on two small feet. For me, it wasn't rigid enough, so I made many changes to it.
