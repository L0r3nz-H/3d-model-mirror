## 📝 Description
The case is based on the [Raspberry Pi Zero W Snap-In Case Remix](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3859266) of [Bigjeffrey](https://www.thingiverse.com/bigjeffrey/designs).

I modded it and designed a stand for it.

The V1 stand is friction fitted and I haven't tested the V2 yet.

If you want to use a heatsink, I would recommend installing it after the RPi is inserted into the case, otherwise you may have problems closing the case.

I have tested it with RPi Zero and Zero 2. Both fit great in the case.
If you want to use a Raspberry Pi Camera (V. 1.3, V. 2 or HQ) it should work fine. But I have tested it only with the V. 1.3.
